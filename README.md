## 📄 Description

This project is a complete **Clinic Booking System** implemented using **MySQL**. It is designed to help clinics manage:

- Patient information
- Doctor profiles
- Departmental organization
- Appointment bookings
- Medical records (diagnosis & prescriptions)

It follows a relational structure with clearly defined relationships (1-to-1, 1-to-many) and includes constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE fields.

The sample data uses realistic Kenyan names to reflect a local healthcare setup.
